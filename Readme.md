# WVD Shadowing

Providing Remote Support, Shadowing, for a WVD Session is currently not available 'Out of the Box' in WVD

To Shadow a use you can use the following command:

mstsc.exe /v:_'Session Host FQDN'_ or _'IP'_ /shadow:_'Session ID'_

There are two additional, optional switches
- /noConsentPrompt
  <br>Allows you to connect to the users session without them being prompted to all the connection
  <br>_**Note:**_ If the GPO Setting **Set rules for remote control of Remote Desktop Services user sessions** is set to force the Consent Prompt then this switch has no effect
- /Control
  <br>Allows you to interact with the users session (if not set â€“ a users session is in view mode only)

This means Support have to find out which Session Host the User is connected too and their Session ID to be able to run this command

Therefore, I wrote these PowerShell scripts to automate this process
